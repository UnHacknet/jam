# UnHacknetJam

An unofficial Hacknetjam focused on the vanilla game.

## What is this?

This jam is a personal initiative by [FBIK.](https://fbik.top) to champion a distinct design philosophy for Hacknet Extensions:

**Powerful, innovative experiences can also be forged strictly within Vanilla Hacknet’s constraints**

We operate on the belief that true creativity emerges from limitations, and thrives in a space of exploration rather than crunch.

## Goal

To encourage Hacknet Extension developers to explore creation from a fresh perspective:

**Unleash the potential of Hacknet Extensions.**

## Timeline & Participation

### Core Event: A 1-Month Creative Cycle

A generous month-long period designed for thoughtful experimentation and iteration. The emphasis is on **sustainable creation, free from time pressure.**

### Ongoing Creative Challenge

The **creative prompt** revealed at the start of the cycle remains an open invitation. We welcome and encourage creations inspired by it **at any time, even after the core event concludes.**

## The Challenge

~~All entries are inspired by a specific **creative prompt** (which may include thematic, technical, or design constraints). The prompt will be revealed by the host ([FBIK.](https://fbik.top)) at the start of the 1-month window and will remain published here afterward.~~

**Actions are restricted for use!**

- You may use the following **only as StartingActions**, and their condition must be `OnConnect target="playerComp"`: AddAsset, AppendToFile, DeleteFile, CopyAsset

## Participate

### For the Core 1-Month Event

To be included in the jam timeline highlights, extensions must be uploaded to the Steam Workshop **within the 1-month window** and tagged with `#UnHacknetJam2026`.

You are welcome to iterate on your submission throughout the month. It is meant to encourage exploration, polish, and a healthy pace. Focus on a complete, solid idea rather than an overly ambitious scope.

### For the Ongoing Creative Challenge

The creative prompt remains open for interpretation indefinitely.
Simply use the `#UnHacknetJam2026` tag on Steam Workshop whenever you finish! We may feature late submissions in future community highlights.

## Recognition & Community

After the core event, we will celebrate the work in two ways:

- **Community's Choice Highlights:** A curated list of extensions that received the most positive feedback and plays from fellow participants.
- **Host's Selection Highlights:** A separate list of extensions that, in the host's view, most compellingly explore or demonstrate the jam's core design philosophy.

The purpose is to showcase diverse approaches and spark discussion.

## Judgement

Participants are encouraged to rate and provide constructive feedback on each other's work.

### Community's Choice Highlights

If you wish to rate other entries, please assess them on the following aspects (scores are given in increments of 0.5):

- **Story / Narrative** (2.5 points)
- **Completion / Polish** (2.5 points)
- **Creativity / Concept** (2.5 points)
- **Fun / Enjoyment** (2.5 points)

A dedicated method for submitting community ratings during the core event will be provided closer to or during the event.

Don't forget to show your email on the workshop description. It will be used to the Judgement of Community's Choice Highlights.

### Host's Selection Highlights

The Host's Selection Highlights are curated solely by [FBIK.](https://fbik.top) based on the philosophical alignment described in [#What is this?](#what-is-this). This is a personal initiative to spotlight work that aligns with its core vision.

### Potential After Spotlight

The host may also review exceptional submissions to the **Ongoing Creative Challenge** throughout **2026**. While these late entries are not part of the core event, standout works **may be featured in a separate, year-end spotlight** at the host's discretion, celebrating great ideas that emerged beyond the initial timeframe.

## A Note on Support

This jam is run voluntarily. There are no cash prizes. The primary rewards are **community recognition, constructive feedback, and the satisfaction of creating something new within interesting constraints.**

Should future community sponsorship or partnerships arise to support creators, details will be transparently communicated here. The current focus is purely on the craft, the community, and the joy of experimentation.
