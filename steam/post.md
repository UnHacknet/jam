# UnHacknetJam

An unofficial Hacknetjam focused on the vanilla game.

## What is this?

This jam is a personal initiative by [FBIK.](https://steamcommunity.com/id/bovinebeta) to champion a distinct design philosophy for Hacknet Extensions:

**Powerful, innovative experiences can also be forged strictly within Vanilla Hacknet’s constraints**

We operate on the belief that true creativity emerges from limitations, and thrives in a space of exploration rather than crunch.

## Goal

To encourage Hacknet Extension developers to explore creation from a fresh perspective:

**Unleash the potential of Hacknet Extensions.**

## Timeline & Participation

### Core Event: A 1-Month Creative Cycle

A generous month-long period designed for thoughtful experimentation and iteration. The emphasis is on **sustainable creation, free from time pressure.**

### Ongoing Creative Challenge

The **creative prompt** revealed at the start of the cycle remains an open invitation. We welcome and encourage creations inspired by it **at any time, even after the core event concludes.**

## The Challenge

**Actions are restricted for use!**

- You may use the following **only as StartingActions**, and their condition must be `OnConnect target="playerComp"`: AddAsset, AppendToFile, DeleteFile, CopyAsset
- You may use the following freely: ShowNode, RunFunction, StartScreenBleedEffect, CancelScreenBleedEffect, SaveGame, HideNode, HideAllNodes, GivePlayerUserAccount

**You may NOT use any mods or tools that alter how Hacknet runs**

Exceptions:

- [fengxu-30338/HacknetChineseSupport](https://github.com/fengxu-30338/HacknetChineseSupport) (essentially a Pathfinder mod to use custom fonts) but you can not open the MultiColorFontParse.
- [fengxu-30338/HacknetFontReplace](https://github.com/fengxu-30338/HacknetFontReplace) New Version of HacknetChineseSupport, but you can not open the MultiColorFontParse.
- Any tools installed locally for development assistance that are not required for players to use. (e.g., [AutumnRivers/HacknetThemeEditor](https://github.com/AutumnRivers/HacknetThemeEditor))

## Dates

The core 1-month creative cycle is currently planned for **February 2026**.

_The creative challenge itself has no deadline._

## Rules

- You shoud strictly follow **The Challenge**.
- All entries must comply with [the Hacknet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.hacknet-os.com/Support/CodeOfConduct.txt). Use only assets you have the right to use, and be respectful to others.
- You are encouraged to form teams and collaborate on submissions.
- To keep the spirit of the jam fresh, any extension submitted before the jam prompt is revealed is not eligible for the jam timeline highlights.
- To ensure a fair and consistent review process for all participants, please do not update your Workshop submission after the 1-month event concludes. If you wish to continue developing your extension, we encourage you to create a new Workshop item for the updated version.
- Please show your email on the workshop description. It will be used to the Judgement of Community's Choice Highlights.

## Participate

### For the Core 1-Month Event

To be included in the jam timeline highlights, extensions must be uploaded to the Steam Workshop **within the 1-month window** and tagged with `#UnHacknetJam2026`.

You are welcome to iterate on your submission throughout the month. It is meant to encourage exploration, polish, and a healthy pace. Focus on a complete, solid idea rather than an overly ambitious scope.

### For the Ongoing Creative Challenge

The creative prompt remains open for interpretation indefinitely.
Simply use the `#UnHacknetJam2026` tag on Steam Workshop whenever you finish! We may feature late submissions in future community highlights.

## Recognition & Community

After the core event, we will celebrate the work in two ways:

- **Community's Choice Highlights:** A curated list of extensions that received the most positive feedback and plays from fellow participants.
- **Host's Selection Highlights:** A separate list of extensions that, in the host's view, most compellingly explore or demonstrate the jam's core design philosophy.

The purpose is to showcase diverse approaches and spark discussion.

## Judgement

Participants are encouraged to rate and provide constructive feedback on each other's work. See [jam.hacknet.wiki/#judgement](https://jam.hacknet.wiki/#judgement) for more details.

Don't forget to show your email on the workshop description. It will be used to the Judgement of Community's Choice Highlights.
