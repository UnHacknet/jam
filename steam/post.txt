[h1]UnHacknetJam[/h1]

An unofficial Hacknetjam focused on the vanilla game.

[h2]What is this?[/h2]

This jam is a personal initiative by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/bovinebeta]FBIK.[/url] to champion a distinct design philosophy for Hacknet Extensions:

[b]Powerful, innovative experiences can also be forged strictly within Vanilla Hacknet’s constraints[/b]

We operate on the belief that true creativity emerges from limitations, and thrives in a space of exploration rather than crunch.

[h2]Goal[/h2]

To encourage Hacknet Extension developers to explore creation from a fresh perspective:

[b]Unleash the potential of Hacknet Extensions.[/b]

[h2]Timeline &amp; Participation[/h2]

[h2]Participate[/h2]

[h3]For the Core 1-Month Event[/h3]

To be included in the jam timeline highlights, extensions must be uploaded to the Steam Workshop [b]within the 1-month window[/b] and tagged with [code]#UnHacknetJam2026[/code].

You are welcome to iterate on your submission throughout the month. It is meant to encourage exploration, polish, and a healthy pace. Focus on a complete, solid idea rather than an overly ambitious scope.

[h3]For the Ongoing Creative Challenge[/h3]

The creative prompt remains open for interpretation indefinitely.
Simply use the [code]#UnHacknetJam2026[/code] tag on Steam Workshop whenever you finish! We may feature late submissions in future community highlights.

[h2]Recognition &amp; Community[/h2]

After the core event, we will celebrate the work in two ways:

[list]
  [*] [b]Community's Choice Highlights:[/b] A curated list of extensions that received the most positive feedback and plays from fellow participants.
  [*] [b]Host's Selection Highlights:[/b] A separate list of extensions that, in the host's view, most compellingly explore or demonstrate the jam's core design philosophy.
[/list]

The purpose is to showcase diverse approaches and spark discussion.

[h2]Judgement[/h2]

Participants are encouraged to rate and provide constructive feedback on each other's work. See [url=https://jam.hacknet.wiki/#judgement]jam.hacknet.wiki/#judgement[/url] for more details.
